== Compilation ==
This projects uses Ant [1] via Netbeans [2] for an automated build process.
I may work without Netbeans, just try it.

== Installation ==
Just copy the .jar to your mobile via Bluetooth, IrDA, cable or download it
from the web. If your mobile supports Java with MIDP-1 everything should
work out of the box.
