== Compilation ==
This projects uses maven. I should work with every maven-installation starting
from Maven 2.0.9, perhaps even below.

== Installation ==
Just copy the .jar to your mobile via Bluetooth, IrDA, cable or download it
from the web. If your mobile supports Java with MIDP-1 everything should
work out of the box.

== License ==
For source-code license see file COPYING in this directory.
Contents of the folder src/site may have different licences (parts are derived
from Maven, which has Apache-License 2.0) and some logos may have other
licenses.
